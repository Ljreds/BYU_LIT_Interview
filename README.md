# BYU_LIT_Interview
A repository to hold the interview problems for the Library's Information Technology

## Approach & Rationale

For this submission, I chose to complete the second assignment. I believed this assignment offered the best opportunity to demonstrate my technical skills and problem-solving abilities relevant to the position.

My approach was to identify four simple but illustrative functions, each serving a distinct purpose. To make my work easy to review and test, I implemented a simple command-line system that allows users to activate each function individually. This requires minimal setup and makes it straightforward for reviewers to interact with and evaluate each function.

### Why Assignment 2?

- It provided a clear framework to showcase core programming concepts and best practices.
- The structure allowed me to highlight my ability to write clean, modular, and user-friendly code.
- I felt it best aligned with the skills and qualities the BYU LIT team is seeking.

### How to Use

- Run the main program from the command line. You will be presented with options to execute each function individually.
- Instructions for running and testing each function are provided in the relevant files or comments.
- My code is documented to clarify the logic and my decision-making process for each part.
